  abstract = {This book describes mathematical models and numerical
                  techniques for simulating the electrical activity in
                  the heart. The book gives an introduction to the
                  most important models of the field, followed by a
                  detailed description of numerical techniques for the
                  models. Particular focus is on efficient numerical
                  methods for large scale simulations on both scalar
                  and parallel computers. The results presented in the
                  book will be of particular interest to researchers
                  in bioengineering and computational biology, who
                  face the challenge of solving these complex
                  mathematical models efficiently. The book will also
                  serve as a valuable introduction to a new and
                  exciting field for computational scientists and
                  applied mathematicians.},
