Collection of tests for beatadjoint
===================================

Running the tests:
------------------

We recommend running the tests from the test/ directory. The complete
test suite can be run with:

  python test.py

In order to only run tests in specified sub-directories, do

  python test.py subdirectory1 subdirectory2 ...

Organizing the tests:
---------------------

* Place proper unit tests under unit/

* Place proper regression tests under regression/

* Place tests that just check whether something run under system/

* Add other test directories at will.
