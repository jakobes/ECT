This is a fairly realistic demo illustrating how to use cbcbeat
for a non-trivial simulation involving real meshes of the left and
right ventricle, stimulation data based on mesh functions etc. The run
time is fairly long, so for demo purposes, just try the following.

First, run the script 'preprocess_conductivities.py' to generate
conductivities from the other data::

  python preprocess_conductivities.py

Next, run the demo with a low end time to see if things seem to be
running.

  python demo.py --T 1.0
