1.2 Understand why BasicCardiacODESolver and CardiacODESolver gives
   pretty different results. (Check.)

1.3 Check sanity of cardiac ode solver results. [TODO]

2. Improve storage format (using hdf5) (Check)

3. Modify stimulus to that forward model runs in parallel. Check that
   results are as before when running in parallel.

4. Set-up code for Taylor test for (shortened) forward simulation

5. ...
